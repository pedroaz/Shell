# Shell

Hey, welcome to Shell!

## What is Shell?

I kind of got tired of having multiple files where I would store some code snippets, useful assets and just good information in general.

So I decided to create Shell. A bundle of multiple types of assets, ranging from sprites to code.

I divided into the following sections:

### 1. Unity Assets - Already imported and ready to use. Current version which I'm using is **2019.2.0f1**
   * Shell Components
      * [x] Persistent Data Manager
      * [x] Screen Transition Manager
      * [x] Sound Manager
    * Utilities
      * [ ] Percentage Picker
   * Pre-made sprites with animations
     * [ ] Find one 
   
### 2. Raw Database of sprites and sounds (with link and credits when it's necessary)

### 3. Python / Heoroku / PostgreSQL / Google Sheets - Mainly quick useful stuff and some small apps on heroku. How to do it so I don't have to google it everytime. 

### 4. AWS / C# / PostgreSQL - Some guides on how to deploy some server side scripts on AWS for my games.

### 5. Random Guides
